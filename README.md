Most bluetooth headsets can't automatically switch among different computers or phones. You have to first disconnect the headset and then connect another device to it. BluePreempt is a tool helping to connect your bluetooth headset occupied by another device in a preemptive way. 

### Usage

BluePreempt has a **Windows** client named "BluePreempt" and a **Android** client named "ABluePreempt". Thus it supports switching a bluetooth headset among Windows or phones.

Windows / Android clients are quite similar. The functions are performed with three buttons: Scan, Mark, and Connect.

1. Open BluePreempt / ABluePreempt on computers and phones to enable the switch of headset among these devices.
1. **Scan** bluetooth devices.
2. Select and **Mark** the bluetooth headset that allows other devices to disconnect.
3. **Connect** to the headset on the computer / phone in use.

The Android client needs the following permissions:

- Bluetooth Permission
- Location Permission
- GPS service

Please add ABluePreempt to **Battery Optimization Whitelist** in order to respond to remote requests in background.
